- It works, well done! üëç
- For the `for` course, make sure that the names of the variables are correct. The loop for padding is in the loop with `i` and must therefore again be given the letter` j`.
- You always skip over the padding, and then return with `fseek`. It makes more sense to only skim the padding when you actually start reading a new line.
- You iterate over the scanlines of the infile, but use the `bi.biHeight` for that which has since been multiplied by the factor.
- Comment looks great!

- The program works!
- Always check whether a file has been successful when opening a file. If it fails and you just continue your program will crash.
- Avoid magic numbers where possible, for this you can often create better constants with for example `#define`.
- Your program now makes two calls to `fwrite ()` but by restructuring the logic this could also be one call.
- Good comments!

* Avoid using magic numbers (like `23`). Use `#define` instead.

* Given your level, it would be good to think about making your code more general. How can you make a stronger separation between data and algorithm? Think about lookup tables, `#define`'s, etc.

* It is hard to do this problem with good design. But try to avoid replicating code. By creating separate cases for you key-length you create way to much repetition in your code. This makes your code very prone to bugs and hard to alter/extend.

* Well written code!
* There is an easier way to test if `s` is an empty string: E.g., `return !s[0]`.
* You could have made the code much more elegant by using a lookup table for the conversion of `note[0]` to `n`.

* Very good!
* Don't forget to mention which sort you're implementing (counting sort).
* Pro tip: It is convention to make upper bounds exclusive in computer science. So `high = n`, not `high = n - 1`.  Of course this would require some more adjustments to the code.
